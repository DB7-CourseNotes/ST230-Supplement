In the output of combn(), we could take each column and just reverse the order. This gives us 6 more possibilities.\nIf we were choosing three items, then each combination could be rearranged in six different permutations. In this case, the number of permutations is 6 (3!) times as large as the number of combinations.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.",

We can use this to demonstrate probability!\nIf we were to roll 6,000 dice, how many of them would show a 1? Note that the following two statements are different!\n\nA 1 should show up in 1/6 rolls, so we expect approximately 1,000 1s.\nIf we get 1,000 1s, then the probability is approximately 1/6.\n\nOur definition is based on the second point, but instead of 6,000 times we roll the dice an infinite number of times (although I don’t recommend literally doing this, that will hurt your wrist).\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nProbabilities from theory: For the combinations/permutations, we can basically use R as a calculator.\nL02 notes Example 1.3.1: What is the probability of drawing an ace from a well-shuffled deck of 52 playing cards?\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nL02 notes Example 1.3.2: Find the probability that a randomly chosen Lotto Max entry wins the Jackpot.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.\nL02 notes Example 1.3.2: Probability of matching 6 out of 7 numbers: \\(P(6\\text{ out of }7) = \\dfrac{\\phantom{1}_{7}C_6 \\phantom{1}_{42}C_1}{ \\phantom{1}_{49}C_7}\\)\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to experience the dynamic code cell content on this page.",
