Of course it has distributions built in! The distribution function always starts with the letter d.\nThe cumulative distribution function is also very useful. In R, the cumulative distribution functions always start with a p.\nNote that \\(P(X \\ge 3) = 1 - P(X \\le 2)\\). We’ll first calculate \\(P(X \\le 2)\\):\nAnd so the answer is:\nThe question above found \\(P(X \\ge 3)\\) is approximately 8%. What if we were given that \\(P(X \\le q)\\) is equal to \\(p\\) (where \\(p\\) is given), how would we find \\(q\\)?\nLet’s go back to the coin flipping example. Suppose now we’re flipping 50 coins. We expect that 50% of the time, we’ll get 25 or fewer heads. That is, \\(P(X \\le 25) = 0.5\\). How many heads do we need to flip in order for \\(P(X \\le x)\\) to be equal to 25%?\nIn the double check, we see that \\(P(X \\le 47)\\) is actually equal to 33%?!?! Why is this? Let’s see what happens if we check the next number down.\nThe probability that X is less than 22 is less than 25%. By convention, The inverse CDF is a function that finds the value \\(q\\) such that \\(P(X \\le q)\\) is at least \\(p\\). This is easier to see in the plot of the cdf:\nThere’s clearly no place where the cdf is equal to 0.25. Instead, we could choose either 0.24 (\\(P(X \\le 22)\\)) or 0.33 (\\(P(X \\le 23)\\)). It might seem convenient to take the closest point, but mathematicians always prefer consistency. In this case, consistency means always rounding up.",

Magic!\nThis distribution describes the sample means from all possible samples that the researchers could get from the population that we defined. It’s unlikely that a researcher would collect a sample whose mean is larger than 4, but it sometimes happens. It’s almost certain that no researcher would take a sample of eruptions and come out with an average eruption time of 4.5 minutes!\nPlay with the code above to see what happens with different sample sizes. Is it still a sample mean of 4 minutes that is reaches the threshold of “unlikely”?",
